# database/schema/*.sql is an append-only log of changes that have already been
# applied — useful for history, useless for reading a table's current shape,
# because a table like tournament_details is spread across a dozen of them in an
# order nothing records. This script regenerates the single file that does say.

# Run it after any schema change so the snapshot does not drift:

#
# Structure only — no rows are read, so the output never contains customer data.
# It does contain function bodies; those are reviewed for secrets by the check at
# the end of this script.
